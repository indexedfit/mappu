this should be a containment zone/echo chamber and modulation/amplification facility for all map related autism. 

in fact, it should extend into the physical world as much as possible, in the form of physical maps, but mainly capturing autism as well.  


so yes, social maps fit in here. but this is also social media. 



start with the calendar+map type feature. events api but can be extended for a lot. 
close friends instasharing? is this a worth feature? 


how should or will this scale? p2p connections might be a bit hard, but sharing encrypted data or similar might be better... idk.



this should actually be a pretty quick app, but! 


one feature it should have, is friends + friends + 1 style local chats. one public for each "city" (these are just topics I believe)


and then one for people you know (grapevine) 


nyc might be a bit of a clusterfuck for this, but maybe these are the only 2 real social modulations you need, "friends" + friends + 1 and public arena forum....



again, if you figure out a way to cheaply scale this, market or not//bootstrapped, that will be quite cool.
